**Artificial intelligence** could be used to support social sustainability preventing tragedies and improving rescue teams efficiency.

_ECoastal_ could give useful insights, like monthly and weakly flows, using machine learning predictive models trained with several kind of data, for instance weather conditions, socio-cultural, politic and geographic circumstances.

It could be used by European Government and the Coast Guard to know in advance where to displace rescue ships and how to optimize food and health resources at the main relief centers along coastal cities.
