# Data Stuff

In this folder you can find some references and topic that I find really interesting!

Personally, my favorite data-resources are:
* [KD Nuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/)
* [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/)
* [Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/)
* [Harvard Business Review - Data](https://hbr.org/topic/data)
* [MIT Sloan Review - Data & Analytics](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/topic/data-and-analytics/)
* [Journal of Machine Learning Research](http://www.jmlr.org/)

P.S. _Work in progress_
