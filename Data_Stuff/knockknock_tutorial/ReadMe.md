_Descrition:_

A small library to get a notification when your training is complete or when it crashes during the process with two additional lines of code.

When training deep learning models, it is common to use early stopping. Apart from a rough estimate, it is difficult to predict when the training will finish. Thus, it can be interesting to set up automatic notifications for your training. It is also interesting to be notified when your training crashes in the middle of the process for unexpected reasons.
