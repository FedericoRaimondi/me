### Hi! It's nice to see you here!

Let me introduce myself...

I'm Federico and I am a data enthusiast.

I have always been a *numeric* person, and two years ago I dived into data.
After that day, I started discovering this wonderful world and I can't remember a day in which I learnt nothing.

## *In this repository you can find:*
#### 1. Information some of the projects I had the pleasure to be part of, such as code, descriptions and results
#### 2. My [resume](https://github.com/FedericoRaimondi/me/tree/master/resume) in which I describe my experiences
#### 3. Collection of data-related topics that I consider worth reading (i.e. papers, blogs, links)



P.S. Please notice that I am updating this repo. Soon, you will be able to see it completed :laughing:
