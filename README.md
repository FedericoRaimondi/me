### Hi! It's nice to see you here!

Let me introduce myself...

My name is **_Federico_** and I am a **_data enthusiast_**. ðŸ’»ðŸ“Š

I have always been a *numeric* person and few years ago I dived into *data science* field as a student. Since that day, I have been discovering this wonderful world and I can't recall a day in which I didn't learn something.

## *In this repository you can find:*
#### 1. Information about projects I am working on, such as code, descriptions and results:
- [Santander_Customer_Transaction_Prediction](https://github.com/FedericoRaimondi/me/tree/master/Santander_Customer_Transaction_Prediction)
#### 2. My [Resume & Certifications](https://github.com/FedericoRaimondi/me/tree/master/Resume%20%26%20Certifications) in which I describe my experiences
#### 3. Collection of data-related topics that I consider worth reading (i.e. papers, blogs, links)

P.S. Please notice that I am updating this repo. It will be available very soon! :laughing:
