### Hi! It's nice to see you here!

Let me introduce myself...

My name is **_Federico_** and I am a **_data enthusiast_**. ðŸ’»ðŸ“Š

I have always been a *numeric* person and few years ago I dived into *data science* field as a student. Since that day, I have been discovering and working in this wonderful world and I can't recall a day in which I didn't learn something.
