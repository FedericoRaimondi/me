#### Hi, it's nice to see you here! Let me introduce myself...

My name is **_Federico_** and I'm a data scientist and, most importantly, I'm a **data enthusiast**. 💻📊

I have always been a numeric person and a few years ago I dived into data science. Since that day, I have been discovering and working in this wonderful world and I can't recall a day in which I didn't learn something.

My motto?
