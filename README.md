### Hi! It's nice to see you here!

Let me introduce myself...

My name is **_Federico_** and I am a **_data enthusiast_**. ðŸ’»ðŸ“Š

I have always been a *numeric* person and two years ago I dived into *data science*. Since that day, I have been discovering this wonderful world and I can't recall a day in which I didn't learn something.

## *In this repository you can find:*
#### 1. Information about some projects I had the pleasure to be part of, such as code, descriptions and results
#### 2. My [resume](https://github.com/FedericoRaimondi/me/tree/master/resume) in which I describe my experiences
#### 3. Collection of data-related topics that I consider worth reading (i.e. papers, blogs, links)

---

P.S. Please notice that I am updating this repo. It will be available very soon! :laughing:
