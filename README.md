My name is **_Federico_** and I'm a data scientist and, most importantly, I'm a **data enthusiast**. ðŸ’»ðŸ“Š

I have always been a numeric person and few years ago I dived into data science. Since that day, I have been discovering and working in this wonderful world and I can't recall a day in which I didn't learn something.

## *In this repository you can find:*
