# Exploratory Data Analysis

In this section, I share the code I used to explore Santander dataset.

You can find an [EDA Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/FedericoRaimondi/me/blob/master/Santander_Customer_Transaction_Prediction/Exploratory_Data_Analysis/Data%20Exploration.ipynb) with all the steps I did explained.
