# Predictive Analysis and Model Tuning

In this section, you can find jupyter notebooks with the aim to predict a fine tune algorithms.

- *[PredictiveAnalysis_ModelTuning.ipynb](https://github.com/FedericoRaimondi/me/blob/master/Santander_Customer_Transaction_Prediction/PredictiveAnalysis_ModelTuning/PredictiveAnalysis_ModelTuning.ipynb)* : Explanation of top scores solutions and how to create a high perfoming LGBM
- *[PredictiveAnalysis_ModelTuning_GPU.ipynb](https://github.com/FedericoRaimondi/me/blob/master/Santander_Customer_Transaction_Prediction/PredictiveAnalysis_ModelTuning/PredictiveAnalysis_ModelTuning_GPU.ipynb)* : Comparison between CPU and GPU version of LGBM through Google Colab running environment
