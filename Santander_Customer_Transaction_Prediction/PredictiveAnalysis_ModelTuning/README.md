# Predictive Analysis and Model Tuning

In this section, you can find jupyter notebooks where I build, fine tune and compare ML algorithms.

- *[PredictiveAnalysis_ModelTuning.ipynb](PredictiveAnalysis_ModelTuning.ipynb)* : Explanation of top scores solutions and how to create a high perfoming LGBM
- *[PredictiveAnalysis_ModelTuning_GPU.ipynb](PredictiveAnalysis_ModelTuning_GPU.ipynb)* : Comparison between CPU and GPU version of LGBM through Google Colab running environment
- *[gbms-cpu-vs-gpu-400-features-augmentation.ipynb](gbms-cpu-vs-gpu-400-features-augmentation.ipynb)* : Comparison between CPU and GPU LGBM vs GPU CatBoost using Kaggle Kernel running environment
